# MainSequence
A game of gravity, released in ~2012 for Xbox 360 and Windows Phone. Main Sequence was the 3rd highest rated “Strategy & Simulation” game on the Xbox 360 Indy store.

This repo also includes the code for the never-released Windows build. The windows build includes mouse support, and support for *many* more game objects per level.

# State of the build
This project was originally built in Visual Studio 2010 with the XNA game framework. Neither of these tools are supported today (in 2024). Compiling may not be simple.

# Music and sound licensing
This project uses music and sound effect files covered by separate licenses, chosen by their respective creators. Details can be found in the [credits code](https://github.com/DavidWAbrahams/MainSequence/blob/main/Accretion/Accretion/GraphicHelpers/CreditsHelper.cs).
